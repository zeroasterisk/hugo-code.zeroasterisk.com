      <description>Last night I started playing with `meteor &amp;#8211;release 0.9.2-rc1` which you can read about and play with too; check it out here:

It&amp;#8217;s wonderful!
The local development and hot-code-push is a great improvement over any other solution I&amp;#8217;ve been using. Builds were painless (mostly).
Most of my stumbling points were due to 9x, not the new Cordova stuff.
A few interesting details&amp;#8230;
Cordova gets built here:

This advice might be aimed at people who already consider themselves developers, but there&amp;#8217;s a nugget in there that&amp;#8217;s perfect for anyone who is interested in getting started&amp;#8230;
Pick some open-source project, probably a smaller one, that does something you&amp;#8217;re interested in. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s something you tried out and used. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s something you tried out and it didn&amp;#8217;t work out. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s something you looked at and didn&amp;#8217;t understand.</description>

About Meteor and PhoneGap / Cordova Meteor is a rapid server/client development framework, written in JS &amp;#8211; makes very interactive apps easy to build. http://meteor.com
PhoneGap / Cordova is a project to allow developers to use HTML, CSS, and JS to build mobile apps for all major devices. http://phonegap.com
Basics of Integrating Meteor + PhoneGap / Cordova The basic idea here is to use PhoneGap / Cordova to create a mobile App on several different platforms at once and it gives device hardware access; then “load” your Meteor application, which handles all of the rest of whatever you want your app to do.</description>
