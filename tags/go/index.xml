      <description>Why&amp;hellip; oh why&amp;hellip; why did I wait so long?
I&amp;rsquo;ve been talking about switching to a static site generator for years, since jekyllrb started gaining popularity.
I understood the benefits, but I had no compelling reason to switch&amp;hellip; (sort of how I resisted git for a few years because svn worked well enough)
But who wants a WordPress site?
Well, ok, maybe you are using 12 plugins and doing fancy stuff.</description>
