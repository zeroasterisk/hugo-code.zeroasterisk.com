      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been playing with &lt;a href=&#34;https://meteor.com/&#34;&gt;Meteor&lt;/a&gt; 1.5 and it&amp;rsquo;s dynamic imports,
which can be used to reduce the amount of javascript code sent to the browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article is a deep dive into how to profile and optimize your client side code
to make smarter use of the new dynamic imports&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which will make &lt;strong&gt;meteor load faster for your users&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Why&amp;hellip; oh why&amp;hellip; why did I wait so long?
I&amp;rsquo;ve been talking about switching to a static site generator for years, since jekyllrb started gaining popularity.
I understood the benefits, but I had no compelling reason to switch&amp;hellip; (sort of how I resisted git for a few years because svn worked well enough)
But who wants a WordPress site?
Well, ok, maybe you are using 12 plugins and doing fancy stuff.</description>

      <title>Meteor 0.9.2-rc1 is fun to play with, Cordova support functional</title>

      <description>Last night I started playing with `meteor &amp;#8211;release 0.9.2-rc1` which you can read about and play with too; check it out here:
https://meteor.hackpad.com/Getting-Started-With-Cordova-Z5n6zkVB1xq
It&amp;#8217;s wonderful!
The local development and hot-code-push is a great improvement over any other solution I&amp;#8217;ve been using. Builds were painless (mostly).
Most of my stumbling points were due to 9x, not the new Cordova stuff.
A few interesting details&amp;#8230;
Cordova gets built here:

      <title>Great advice from Arunoda “Just Contribute!”</title>

This advice might be aimed at people who already consider themselves developers, but there&amp;#8217;s a nugget in there that&amp;#8217;s perfect for anyone who is interested in getting started&amp;#8230;
Pick some open-source project, probably a smaller one, that does something you&amp;#8217;re interested in. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s something you tried out and used. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s something you tried out and it didn&amp;#8217;t work out. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s something you looked at and didn&amp;#8217;t understand.</description>

&amp;nbsp;
About Meteor and PhoneGap / Cordova Meteor is a rapid server/client development framework, written in JS &amp;#8211; makes very interactive apps easy to build. http://meteor.com
PhoneGap / Cordova is a project to allow developers to use HTML, CSS, and JS to build mobile apps for all major devices. http://phonegap.com
Basics of Integrating Meteor + PhoneGap / Cordova The basic idea here is to use PhoneGap / Cordova to create a mobile App on several different platforms at once and it gives device hardware access; then “load” your Meteor application, which handles all of the rest of whatever you want your app to do.</description>
