      <title>Playing with Elixir is just FUN</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Elixir for a few weeks now, sometimes
&lt;a href=&#34;https://code.zeroasterisk.com/2017/06/meteor-and-elixir-rocky-courtship/&#34;&gt;forcing it to play nice with Mongodb/Meteor&lt;/a&gt;
, which it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really want to do.
Sometimes with Posgres &lt;em&gt;(which it loves)&lt;/em&gt;.
Sometimes just plain ole&amp;rsquo; Elixir with no persistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; realllllly fun!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Meteor and Elixir (part one) A Rocky Courtship</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been watching Elixir for almost 2 years now, and debating if it&amp;rsquo;s mature enough for me to invest in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously Erlang is super-mature, and Elixir is quite stable, but it&amp;rsquo;s a question of &amp;ldquo;is the community mature enough yet?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I&amp;rsquo;m now writing this, I believe it is &amp;ldquo;ready&amp;rdquo;, and I&amp;rsquo;m beginning a journey to build out some services in Elixir
to stand up next to existing node services (meteorjs) and slow move funcitonality over to to Elixir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter One: &lt;strong&gt;Proof of Concept, Mongo is supposed to be Simple.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Meteor 1.5 ~ Bundle Optimization &#43; Examples</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been playing with &lt;a href=&#34;https://meteor.com/&#34;&gt;Meteor&lt;/a&gt; 1.5 and it&amp;rsquo;s dynamic imports,
which can be used to reduce the amount of javascript code sent to the browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article is a deep dive into how to profile and optimize your client side code
to make smarter use of the new dynamic imports&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which will make &lt;strong&gt;meteor load faster for your users&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why wait? Adopt hugo for Static Site Generation</title>

      <description>Why&amp;hellip; oh why&amp;hellip; why did I wait so long?
I&amp;rsquo;ve been talking about switching to a static site generator for years, since jekyllrb started gaining popularity.
I understood the benefits, but I had no compelling reason to switch&amp;hellip; (sort of how I resisted git for a few years because svn worked well enough)
But who wants a WordPress site?
Well, ok, maybe you are using 12 plugins and doing fancy stuff.</description>

      <title>Meteor 0.9.2-rc1 is fun to play with, Cordova support functional</title>

      <description>Last night I started playing with `meteor &amp;#8211;release 0.9.2-rc1` which you can read about and play with too; check it out here:
https://meteor.hackpad.com/Getting-Started-With-Cordova-Z5n6zkVB1xq
It&amp;#8217;s wonderful!
The local development and hot-code-push is a great improvement over any other solution I&amp;#8217;ve been using. Builds were painless (mostly).
Most of my stumbling points were due to 9x, not the new Cordova stuff.
A few interesting details&amp;#8230;
Cordova gets built here:

      <title>Great advice from Arunoda “Just Contribute!”</title>
      <link>https://code.zeroasterisk.com/2014/04/24/great-advice-from-arunoda-contribute/</link>

      <description>http://readme.lk/noticed-tech-crowd-interview-arunoda-susiripala/
This advice might be aimed at people who already consider themselves developers, but there&amp;#8217;s a nugget in there that&amp;#8217;s perfect for anyone who is interested in getting started&amp;#8230;
Pick some open-source project, probably a smaller one, that does something you&amp;#8217;re interested in. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s something you tried out and used. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s something you tried out and it didn&amp;#8217;t work out. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s something you looked at and didn&amp;#8217;t understand.</description>

      <description>UPDATE: see meteor-core-cordova-support-alpha-release-is-out (2014-08-25) for new information
&amp;nbsp;
About Meteor and PhoneGap / Cordova Meteor is a rapid server/client development framework, written in JS &amp;#8211; makes very interactive apps easy to build. http://meteor.com
PhoneGap / Cordova is a project to allow developers to use HTML, CSS, and JS to build mobile apps for all major devices. http://phonegap.com
Basics of Integrating Meteor + PhoneGap / Cordova The basic idea here is to use PhoneGap / Cordova to create a mobile App on several different platforms at once and it gives device hardware access; then “load” your Meteor application, which handles all of the rest of whatever you want your app to do.</description>
